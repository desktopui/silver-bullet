The idea behind it to find out if it makes sense at all for this type of applications.

## What is Cocoa?

## Issues:

- Flawed, sometimes inconsistent comparing to UIKit. Like this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45823615/how-do-you-hide-the-first-header-element-in-a-nsoutlineview

## What is native?

Things that hard to do right to imitate otherwise:

- focus/blurred control state
- SplitView
- restore state api
